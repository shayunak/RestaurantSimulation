# RestaurantSimulation
Advanced operating system project to simulate restaurant with multi-threading.
** Important: To decrease simulation time, each second of simulation was replaced by 100 milliseconds.
How to run on linux:
1. Run "make all" to genrate all .class files.
2. Run "java -classpath out Com.advancedOS.RestaurantManger.Main" for the main class to start.
3. Then you will be prompted for input, feed it with any technique you want. (print it or use <)
4. At last, after a couple of seconds, the output will be on the terminal, showing events in each second(minute) of simulation.
5. If you wish, you can clean up .class files with "make clean" command.

Thank you :)
